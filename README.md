# Tetris-Game

In this project, me and my partner created **The Tetris game**, using C++ language. 

This game include: 

1. 🗒️**Menu** 🗒️ - In the menu you can choose a multiple option to play, such as: 

        a. Human Player against Human Player.
        b. Human Player against Computer Player.
        c. Computer Player against Computer Player.
        - In every option you can choose whether to play the game with or without color.
        - If you choose the Computer Player option, you can choose which difficulty you want the computer to have. (**Best,Good,Novice**)

2. **The  💣**  - In the Game, there is a  💣  which appear every approximately 20 moves, and explode every Tetris piece within a range of 4X4 from the hitting spot.
-In the Computer Player mode, the  💣  algorithm is based on the level of the Computer Player you chose. 

3. 💻**The Computer Algorithm** 💻 - We planned the Computer Player Algorithm in a way that the "BEST" level will indicate the ultimate spot and the ultimate angel which the piece should be dropped. This assessment is based on four heuristics: **aggregate height**, **complete lines**, **holes**, and **bumpiness**.

💪 This project was very difficult but interesting, and we are more than happy from the result. **Hope you enjoy** 💪
